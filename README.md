## HOW TO CLONE THIS REPO ##
It should be pretty straight forwards - navigate to the directory that you want the repo in then run

```git clone https://github.com/HMC-COVID-19-Unpacked/team-2.git```

Now there are two additional branches that you should put into your local repo, get them by running

``` git checkout --track origin/virus ```

``` git checkout --track origin/warmup ```

You can switch between branches by running 

``` git checkout virus ```

``` git checkout warmup ```

``` git checkout master ```

## TASKS ##
1. Warming up with [geographic variation in COVID-19 cases](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=536) 
      * See [Geographic Warmup](https://github.com/abesap/covid19/projects/1)
      * Are there geographic variations in the rate of COVID-19 spread?
      * Are there geographic variations in the mortality rate of COVID-19?
      * Is there any evidence to suggest geographic based virus mutations? 
1. [What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=567) 
      * Real-time tracking of whole genomes and a mechanism for coordinating the rapid dissemination of that information to inform the development of diagnostics and therapeutics and to track variations of the virus over time.
      * Access to geographic and temporal diverse sample sets to understand geographic distribution and genomic differences, and determine whether there is more than one strain in circulation. Multi-lateral agreements such as the Nagoya Protocol could be leveraged.
      * Evidence that livestock could be infected (e.g., field surveillance, genetic sequencing, receptor binding) and serve as a reservoir after the epidemic appears to be over.
      * Evidence of whether farmers are infected, and whether farmers could have played a role in the origin.
          * Surveillance of mixed wildlife- livestock farms for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in Southeast Asia.
          * Experimental infections to test host range for this pathogen.
          * Animal host(s) and any evidence of continued spill-over to humans
    * Socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors for this spill-over
    * Sustainable risk reduction strategies

## Work Flow ## 
Everything will be based on this git repo - including project managment. Please familarize yourself with how projects work in Git. 
### Projects ### 
 We have two projects - available in the [projects](https://github.com/abesap/covid19/projects) tab. They are 
 - [Geographic Warmup](https://github.com/abesap/covid19/projects/1) 
 - [Viral Orgins, Genetics, and Evoluition](https://github.com/abesap/covid19/projects/2)
 
 Projects contain relevant issues - if you're looking for a place to start go over to there. 
 ### Branches and Issues ###
 Each project has its own branch - 
 - [warmup](https://github.com/abesap/covid19/tree/warmup) for the Geographic Warmup
 - [virus](https://github.com/abesap/covid19/tree/virus) for the Viral Origins project
 
 Please work on each project on its respective branch and move issues to the done column by submitting a **pull request** on that branch into master. Refrence the issue in the commit. 

## Weekly/As Needed Meetings ## 
  Meetings will be scheduled for 1:00 pm PST on Fridays - should be a half hour.
